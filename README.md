# About

Adapted code from https://github.com/petergardfjall/garminexport

Barebones Python code to **download Body Score from Garmin**. Assumes you have an account with Garmin Connect. 

Executing this will ask you to enter your Garmin username/email and password. However, it is not stored after execution and acts like any browser (e.g. Chrome) using Garmin Connect, where you'd do the same thing.
